    "Python, being an object-orientated programming language, essentially works on the idea of manipulating various building blocks, which we call objects, in order to achieve a given outcome. Covering the philosophy of object-orientated programming and how objects work is beyond the scope of this workshop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will primarily look at the basic types of Python objects and how they work. Whilst each object is created dynamically, they all have what we call a `type`, which defines how that object behaves. For example, the “Hello World” (introduced in the previous section) is a text based object, also known as a `string`.\n",
