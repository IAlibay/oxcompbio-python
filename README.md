# Oxford Computational Biochemistry Python workshop

This repository contains the teaching materials for the Python workshop from the Oxford Computational Biochemistry course.


## Getting started

In order to participate in this workshop you can either [setup a local Python environment](setup.md), or run the notebooks directly through Binder or Google colab (see badges below).


## The Python workshop


Click here to launch the workshop via binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/IAlibay/oxcompbio-python/main)

This consists of a set of jupyter notebooks which aim to teach the basics of python programming assuming no prior knowledge.
First introducing core concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals and lists, we eventually demonstrate how molecular structures can be analysed using python libraries such as [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/) and [NGLView](http://nglviewer.org/nglview/latest/).
